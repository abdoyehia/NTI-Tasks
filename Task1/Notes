we will create a simple banking system where we can:
Add new clients with these attribute: 
-client name  
-address  
-phone number  
-AccountID-> where the first client's ID is 5000 and and as we add the counter continues
-Intial balance

-each client can do transactions add/withdraw form his account 
-also we can do CRUD operations on the acconts 
-and when we view an account details we get the account details + a table contains the transactions history 

//Side note: handel the transaction cases: 
-check the withdraw capabilities

the client object will look something like that: 
customer {
    name:"",
    address:"",
    phone:"",
    accNum: 5000,
    intialBalane:1000,
    transactions:[
        {transactionType:"add or withdraw", val:500}
    ]
}
